**Project Name:**

**DataSpark – Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics**

**Introduction:**

Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics, is striving to leverage its vast data to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth. This project, titled "DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics," aims to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on their data to uncover valuable insights and actionable recommendations.

**Problem Statement:**

As part of Global Electronics' data analytics team, you are tasked with conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights from the company’s data. Your goal is to provide actionable recommendations that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth.
Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics, has provided you with several datasets containing information about their customers, products, sales, stores, and currency exchange rates.
The company seeks to leverage this data to better understand their business and identify areas for improvement.

**Packages Used:**

**•	Pandas:**

Pandas is a powerful and open-source Python library. The Pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas consist of data structures and functions to perform efficient operations on data.

**Install Packages:**

•	**Pandas** – pip install pandas

•	**MySQL Connector**– pip install mysql-connector-python
 
**Software Used:**

•	**Visual Studio Code:**

Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and web browsers. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded version control with Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality.
Performed EDA in visual studio code.

•	**Power Bi:**

Power BI, or Power Business Intelligence, is a Microsoft platform that helps users analyse, visualize, and share data for business intelligence (BI) purposes. It's a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that can turn data from different sources into interactive insights. Power BI can connect to data from Excel spreadsheets, cloud-based data warehouses, and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. It can then help users build charts, graphs, and dashboards to visualize the data.

**Project Workflow:**

1)	Run the dalacleaning.py file in vs code using ‘python datacleaning.py’ command to clean the data
   
2)	Then run the visualizationData.py file in vs code using ‘python datacleaning.py’ command to get all the data neccessary for analytics
   
3)	Open global_electronics_insights.pbix to go through the customer, sales, stores, product, exchange rate insight of the global electronics.

**Learnt things from this project:**

•	Gained a deep understanding of how to clean and prepare data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and reliability

•	Improved proficiency in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), uncovering insights and patterns in data

•	Strengthened expertise in MySQL, particularly in data storage, retrieval, and management.

•	Developed basic skills in Power BI, enabling the creation of meaningful visualizations and dashboards.

•	Improved the ability to craft compelling narratives around data, effectively communicating insights and recommendations.
